\problem{1}{
        Show that the sequence $f_n = ne^{-nx}$ does not converge weakly in $L^1([0,1])$.
}

\begin{solution}{Esha Datta, James Hughes, Edgar Jaramillo Rodriguez, Jeonghoon Kim, Van Vinh Nguyen, Qianhui Wan}
        For some given $\epsilon >0$ consider the map $T_\epsilon : L^1([0,1])\to \real$ defined by
        \[ T_\epsilon f = \int_0^\epsilon f(x)\,dx  = \int_0^1f(x) \chi_{[0,\epsilon]}(x)\, dx, \]
        Note that since $\chi_{[0,\epsilon]}(x) \in L^\infty([0,1])$ this defines a linear functional on $L^1([0,1])$ (it is also not hard to verify this directly).
        Now, observe that 
        \[ T_\epsilon f_n = \int_0^\epsilon ne^{-nx}\,dx = 1-\frac{1}{e^{-n\epsilon}}, \]
        so $T_\epsilon f_n \to 1$ for all $\epsilon >0$.
        Hence if there did exist some $f \in L^1([0,1])$ such that $f_n \rightharpoonup f$ we would require that 
        \[ \int_0^\epsilon f(x)\,dx = 1 \]
        for all $\epsilon >0$, which is absurd (can prove via DCT).
        Hence $f_n$ cannot converge weakly to any $f \in L^1([0,1])$.
