\problem{2}{Show that if $\{f_n\}$ is a sequence of continuously differentiable function on $[0,1]$ and both the original sequence and the sequence of derivatives are uniformly bounded, then $(f_n)$ has a uniformly convergent subsequence.}

\begin{solution}{Esha Datta, James Hughes, Edgar Jaramillo Rodriguez, Jeonghoon Kim, Van Vinh Nguyen, Qianhui Wan}
        Since the sequence $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly bounded, we can get the equicontinuity of $\{f_n\}$.
        By the equicontinuity and uniform boundedness of $\{f_n\}$, appling Arzela-Ascoli, $\{f_n\}$ is precompact and there exists a subsequence $\{f_{n_k}\}$ converging uniformly.
\end{solution}
