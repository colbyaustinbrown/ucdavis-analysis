\problem{4}{
        Let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be a pair of orthogonal projections onto $H_1$ and $H_2$, respectively, where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are closed subspaces of a Hilbert space $H$.
        Prove that $P_1P_2$ is an orthogonal projection if and only if $P_1$ and $P_2$ commute.
        In that case, prove that $P_1P_2$ is the orthogonal projection onto $H_1 \cap H_2$.

        $(\Rightarrow)$
        Suppose $P_1P_2$ is an orthogonal projection.
        Then $P_1P_2=(P_1P_2)^*=P_2^*P_1^*$.
        By $P_1,P_2$ each orthogonal projections, $P_1=P_1^*$ and $P_2=P_2^*$, so $P_1P_2=P_2P_1$. 

        $(\Leftarrow)$ 
        Suppose $P_1P_2=P_2P_1$.
        Then $P_1P_2=P_2^*P_1^*$ since each is an orthogonal projection, and $P_1P_2=P_2^*P_1^*=(P_1P_2)^*$.
        Observe $(P_1P_2)^2=P_1^2P_2^2$ by commutative assumption,and since each is an orthogonal projection, $(P_1P_2)^2=P_1P_2$.
        Thus, $P_1P_2$ is an orthogonal projection. 

        Assume $P_1P_2$ is an orthogonal projection.
        Take $z\in ran(P_1P_2)$.
        Since they commute $\implies z\in ran(P_2P_1)$.
        Thus $z\in ran(P_1)$ and $z\in ran(P_2)$, so $P_1P_2$ projects onto $H_1 \cap H_2$.
